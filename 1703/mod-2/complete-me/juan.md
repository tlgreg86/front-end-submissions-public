# Comments:
* Testing had some confusing logic set to variables, strive towards making tests extremely readable and straightforward
* That said, the logic I saw in your tests showed a great understanding of the array prototypes and es6
* Suggest is long, room for refactor...but it works! So good job
* Great use of es6 and recursion
