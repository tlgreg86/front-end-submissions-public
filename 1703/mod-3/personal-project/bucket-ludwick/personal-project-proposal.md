#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin 7/24 [late]:

- have application styled so that there is a front end 
- pull in book data have cards rendering so that they're on the page 
   - have a card component 
   - have seperate bookList component 
- It seems like you're going to need a user so we'll need a back-end for this. You'll either user Firebase || Node. Both will have learning curves but I think you'll get a lot of support with Node. FB will be easy to get going but you'll have to really read the docs. *Have this set up by Monday (choose one)*
- have testing setup
