### Deliverables for 7/24

- we need to get some sort of API call into this project. So I think we need to start considering other types of data to get in here 
    - even if its weather data for that particular day / places to eat around the specific address 
    - look into what matters to you. Pick one and start implementing / pulling the data down 
 -  get interfaced with initial style up 
 - start favoriting 
    - it doesn't have to be on the backend but get the css working 
      - extra credit: get it persisting through local storage 
 - have testing suite hooked up.
