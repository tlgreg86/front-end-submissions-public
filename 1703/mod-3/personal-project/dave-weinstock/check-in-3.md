#### Order Of Attack

- Get API calls working
- build first iteration of UI
- finish all major features
- polish UI

#### MVP

App that displays a list of artist names and info about event for concerts in your current location, plus ability to search other locations.

#### Biggest Challenges

- figuring out the Google Maps API and using the react-google-maps NPM package took a while
- had to get creative with geocoding the city/state string into an object with lat and long values to pass along to my event API.

#### Instructor Notes

  
  
#### Deliverables for next checkin:
dynamic routing, single event page built out. ux/ui and tests
