Notes:

Functional Expectations

Proficient	The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.


HTML

Accessibility

Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.

Style

Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS

Structure of Code

Proficient	Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation

Proficient	Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT

Data Types

Exceptional	Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.

Conditional Logic

Advanced Beginner	Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

Functions & Scope

Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Arrays

Proficient	Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

Objects & Prototypes

Proficient	Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

DOM Manipulation

Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style

Proficient	Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB

Git

Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github

Advanced Beginner	Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


PAIRING

Collaboration

Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
